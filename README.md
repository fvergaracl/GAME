# GAME (Goals And Motivation Engine) README üéÆ

## Description üìù

GAME (Goals And Motivation Engine) is a system designed to foster motivation and achievement of goals through gamification. This open-source project utilizes a PostgreSQL database and is developed with FastAPI in Python, managed via Poetry for environment handling.

## Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for local database deployment)
- Poetry

## Environment Setup üåê

### Environment Variables

Before starting the project, it's necessary to configure the environment variables. Copy the environment variables defined in `.env.sample` to `.env`. Below is an example and explanation of each variable:

```
VERSION_APP="1.0.0" # Version of GAME API
ENV=dev # Indicates whether the environment is development or production (dev|production)
DB_ENGINE=postgresql # Database engine
DB_NAME=game_dev_db # Database name
DB_USER=root # Database user
DB_PASSWORD=example # Database password
DB_HOST=localhost # Database host
DB_PORT=5432 # Database port
DEFAULT_CONVERSION_RATE_POINTS_TO_COIN=100 # Default conversion rate of points to coins
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://root:example@localhost:5432/game_dev_db # Database connection URL
```

### Activating the Poetry Environment

To activate the Poetry environment, run:

```
poetry shell
```

If it's your first time running the project, install all dependencies with:

```
poetry install
```

### Database Deployment with Docker Compose

To bring up the database locally, run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

If it's the first time deploying the database, you should initialize it with Alembic:

```
alembic upgrade head
```

### Deploying the REST API

To deploy the REST API, run:

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Other Useful Commands üöÄ

### Alembic (Database Migrations)

- `alembic upgrade head`: Applies all migrations.
- `alembic downgrade base`: Reverts all migrations.
- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "revision_name"`: Creates a new migration.
- `alembic history`: Shows Alembic revision history.

### Server

- `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`: Runs the development server.
  - Options:
    - `--host 0.0.0.0`: Specifies the host.
    - `--port 8000`: Specifies the port.

### Testing

- `pytest`: Runs basic tests.
- `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing`: Runs tests with coverage and displays the report in the terminal.
- `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html`: Generates a coverage report in HTML.
