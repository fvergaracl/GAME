## Key Features ✨

- 🚀 **FastAPI-based**: High-performance API with Python’s FastAPI framework.
- 🛠️ **Modular Design**: Clean architecture, easily extendable.
- 🐋 **Docker Support**: Ready-to-use Docker and Docker Compose setups.
- ☸️ **Kubernetes Ready**: Configuration provided for Kubernetes deployment.
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: Fully integrated testing suite with `pytest` and Codecov for coverage tracking.
