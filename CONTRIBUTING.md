   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GAME.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix:

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fvergaracl/GAME.git
   cd GAME
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Activate the Poetry environment**:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   This will start the API server locally, and any changes you make will automatically reload the application.


## Writing Tests üß™

All contributions should include relevant unit and/or integration tests to ensure the stability of the codebase. You can find existing tests in the `tests/` directory.

To run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To run tests with code coverage:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```



## Code Style Guidelines üìù

We follow PEP 8 for Python code. Before submitting your pull request, ensure your code is properly formatted.

You can use tools like `black` or `flake8` to check your code for style issues:

```bash
poetry run black .
poetry run flake8
```
