## Token expired

If you have a token expired problem, you have 2 options

1) Just log out and login again
2) **(Best way)** In the identity and access management (**Keycloak** in this case) you must change the setting related with the **Access Token Lifespan** . In keycloak, first select the realm that contains your client, then click over "Clients" and select your client , after that select the "Advance" tab an chage the options of **Access Token Lifespan** to the desired time
