Create a Game
-------------

To start, you need to create a game. A game serves as a container for one or more tasks that you can assign to users.

**Endpoint**: ``POST /api/v1/games``

**Request Body**:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "externalGameId": "example_game",
      "platform": "example_platform",
      "strategyId": "socio_bee",
      "params": [
        {
          "key": "variable_basic_points",
          "value": 5
        }
      ]
    }

**Example of response**:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "gameId": "9b22b0f1-ecbf-442f-9574-222ad9b9e262",
        "created_at": "2024-04-08T09:49:24.269447+00:00",
        "updated_at": "2024-04-08T09:49:24.269447+00:00",
        "externalGameId": "example_game",
        "strategyId": "socio_bee",
        "platform": "example_platform",
        "params": [
            {
            "key": "variable_basic_points",
            "value": "5",
            "id": "f4ba61aa-b35f-4d89-9075-94d4a0453180"
            }
        ],
        "message": "Game with gameId: 9b22b0f1-ecbf-442f-9574-222ad9b9e262 created successfully"
    }

- **externalGameId**: This is an identifier external to the GAME system, used to identify the game in the future if necessary. This ID is for informational purposes only and will not be used in the system's internal logic.

- **variable_basic_points** is set to a value of 5. This value can be modified in the future for this game.

This body of the request creates a game with the "socio_bee" strategy, where the basic points variable is initially set to 5. This setup allows for a flexible and dynamic approach to game creation, enabling the modification of game parameters as needed.


*IMPORTANT*: The game ID (**gameId**) is generated by the system and is unique for each game. This ID is used to reference the game in the future, so it is important to store it for future reference.
