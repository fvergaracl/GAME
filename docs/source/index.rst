:og:description: GAME (Goals And Motivation Engine) — an adaptive,
   programmable gamification engine for shaping participation and incentives.

==================================
GAME — Goals And Motivation Engine
==================================

.. rubric:: An adaptive, programmable gamification engine

**GAME** turns user activity into points, coins, and behavioral incentives
through *programmable scoring strategies*. Unlike static points APIs whose
rules are frozen at design time, GAME lets a strategy react to behavior,
context, and system state — so incentives can be **redistributed** toward
under-engaged users, tasks, or regions instead of amplifying the
participation inequality that fixed rules tend to reinforce.

It runs in two shapes:

* as a **complete gamification backend** — manage games, tasks, users,
  point assignment, and wallets; or
* as a **scoring microservice** — your system owns the application logic
  and calls GAME only to compute *how many points* an event is worth.

   This documentation follows the `Diátaxis <https://diataxis.fr/>`_ model —
   it separates *learning-oriented* tutorials, *task-oriented* how-to guides,
   *understanding-oriented* explanation, and dry *reference*. Pick your lane:

   * **I want to call the API in 5 minutes** →
     :doc:`getting-started` then :doc:`authentication`.
   * **I want to integrate GAME into my product** →
     :doc:`integrating` and :doc:`strategies`.
   * **I want to understand how it works** →
     :doc:`overview`, :doc:`architecture`, :doc:`dsl-engine`.
   * **I run it in production** →
     :doc:`configuration`, :doc:`operations`, :doc:`observability`,
     :doc:`security`.
   * **I'm contributing code** →
     :doc:`architecture`, :doc:`codebase`, :doc:`contributing`.

   * - Observability
     - Prometheus ``/metrics``, structured JSON logs, Sentry, sampled DSL
       execution traces, KPI rollups
   * - Reproducibility
     - Deterministic execution, simulation mode (``isSimulated``),
       versionable strategies — usable as an experimental research platform
